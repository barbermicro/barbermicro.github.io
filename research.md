## Bacterial Growth

The bacterial cell wall is an essential polymeric exoskeleton that both prevents bacterial lysis and is targeted by our best frontline antibiotics. Our recent work revealed the fundamental role of wall teichoic acids, an understudied cell wall constituent of Gram-positive bacteria, in regulating both the synthesis and degradation of the primary load-bearing cell wall component: peptidoglycan. We are now leveraging these discoveries to explore the mechanistic basis of cell wall homeostasis, both with and without wall teichoic acids.
